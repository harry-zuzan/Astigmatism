A tool for evaluating astigmatism 

Spokes creates what resembles the spokes of a wheel where the spokes come
in parallel pairs.  This is useful for identifying angles of astigmatism
but not magnitude. If some spokes are well defined and others become
fuzzy this is evidence of an astigmatism.

An optometrist evaluates astigmatism under dim light that few people
would find comparable to how they spend their time. Under brighter light
the opening through the iris is reduced and this can change the angle of
astigmatism.   Also any reasonably smooth curved surface converges to the
surface of a sphere so the magnitude of astigmatisim can be reduced
under bright light.
