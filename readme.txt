Tools for evaluating astigmatism

The optical system of the eye is an already complicated system with 
two important lenses in the path of light from the outside world
onto the retina.

An optometrist evaluates astigmatism under conditions that most people
find undesireable.  For almost anyone, reading the alphabet in a dimly 
lit room with tunnel vision enforced is not quality time that would be
pursued.  Eye exams are tuned to this circumstance with quality of
vision, that affects quality of life, imputed from dim light.  There
are reasons why corretions for astigmatism are overfitted and incorret
under bright light with eyes moving.

Spokes creates what looks like the spokes of a wheel where the spokes come
in parallel pairs.  This is useful for identifying angles of astigmatism.


Irregularity on the surface of the cornea has a more profound effect than
than an irregularity on the lens because of the greater change of speed
of light at the surface of the cornea.

An optical prescription tries to correct for astigmatism by assuming that 
the surface can be approximated by a cylinder intersecting a sphere.  This
is why a prescription is written as sphere plus/minus cylinder.

There are several problems with this.
1. The optical system becomes more complex and light is bent in a more
   complicated way.  The more complex the paths of light, the less 
   the system is able to tolerate deviations from ideals, such as 
   focal length, aperature of the iris, position of the eye, which moves,
   relative to glass lenses which do not move.

2. It is just an approximation of the surface irregularity.  The astigmatism
   cannot be fully corrected.

3. An optometrists correction for astigmatism does not account for the 
   fact that eyes move but glass lenses mounted in frames do not.  The
   consquence is that the prescription is constantly changing as eyes
   move.  A prescription with astigmatism, if it is correct, is only 
   correct when looking straight ahead through the optical centres of
   the lenses.  

4. The effect of the astigmatism depends on how wide the iris in open. This
   is because the surface is not truly shaped like an "American football"
   as many optometrists like to say. Because of this the astigmatism rotates
   as a function of aperature as happens in any optical system with lens
   irregularities.  

5. Astigmatism is evaluated by an optometrist in dim light with irises 
   dialated.  In normal lighting where the iris contracts effect of the
   astigmatism can rotate relative to how it was evaluated.

6. As the iris contracts, depth of field increases which diminishes the 
   effect of the astigmatism.

7. In a properly lit room the iris is closed more than it is in thd dimly
   lit room of an eye exam.  As the iris closes light a smaller region of
   the cornea bends light through the iris.  The cornea is a convex surface
   and any region of a convex surface approaches a sphere  as that region
   The cyinder prescribed for astigmatism does not account for eyes moving,
   The fit is only valid in a dimly lit room looking straight ahead.  In
   a properly lit room the angle of the cylinder prescribed is incorrect
   and the magnitude of cylinder prescribed is too great.

8. Optometrists are not concerned with peripheral vison when prescribing.
   Only the alphabet on the chart as if looking through a tunnel. The
   farther off axis into peripheral vision, the more inaccurate the
   prescription.
 
9. The effect of spherical abberation interacts with the effect of
   astigmatism. 

10. To finish the rant, I have never heard of an optometrist or
   opthamologist bother to walk 10 metres out the door of their office
   into a properly lit area with something to do other than look at a
   chart in order to evaluate whether or not the prescription that was
   issued is subject to improvement.  It is odd to spend a whole career
   imputing vision and never checking to see if the assumptions are off.
